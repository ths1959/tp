## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F13-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/triplog/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F13-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/triplog/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager} class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F13-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/triplog/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TripListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F13-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/triplog/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F13-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

To support a dynamic layout, the `MainWindow` implements a `SplitPane` with a vertical orientation. This `SplitPane` contains two `StackPane` placeholders which house the `TripListPanel` and `ResultDisplay` respectively. This allows the user to manually adjust the relative height of these components while maintaining a consistent internal layout.

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Trip` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F13-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/triplog/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1-3")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1-3` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `TripLogParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a trip).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `TripLogParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `TripLogParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F13-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/triplog/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" alt="Better Model Class Diagram" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the trip log data i.e., all `Trip` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTripList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Trip` objects (e.g., results of a search query or a specific sort) as a separate _filtered/sorted_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Trip>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103-F13-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/triplog/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both trip log data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `TripLogStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.triplog.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

### Trip Creation: Add Command
The `add` command creates a new trip in the trip log. Only the destination name (n/NAME) is mandatory. All other fields (phone, email, address, start date, end date, tags) are optional and default to null if omitted. When both `startDate` and `endDate` are provided, the Trip model validates that the start date is not after the end date.

The parsing is handled by `AddCommandParser`, which tokenizes the input and checks each optional field via `Optional<String>` before constructing the corresponding `AddCommand`.

On execution, `AddCommand` checks for duplicates via `Model#hasTrip(Trip)`. Two trips are considered duplicates if they share the same name (case-insensitive) and have overlapping date ranges, as determined by the private `Trip#datesOverlap()` method. If trip is non-duplicate, it is added to the model.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `add` command is parsed and executed:

<puml src="diagrams/AddSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Add Command Sequence Diagram" />

### Trip Editing: Edit Command
The `edit` command allows for partial updates to an existing trip. The trip to be edited is identified by its index in the current filtered list.

**Mechanism:**
1. **`EditCommandParser`**: Tokenizes the input and stores the changes in an `EditTripDescriptor`. This descriptor is a temporary container that holds only the fields the user intends to change.
2. **`EditCommand`**:
    * Retrieves the original trip from the model using the provided index.
    * Creates an `editedTrip` by merging the original trip's data with the non-empty fields in the `EditTripDescriptor`.
    * **Validation**: It checks that the `editedTrip` is not a duplicate of another trip (excluding the one being edited) and that the new date range is logically valid.
3. **Model Update**: If valid, the model replaces the original trip with the `editedTrip`.

**Duplicate Detection during Edit:**
The `edit` command utilizes `Model#hasTripExcluding(Trip, Trip)`. This ensures that if a user changes a trip's name to match another entry, the command is only rejected if the dates also overlap with that other entry.

### Trip Deletion: Delete Command

The `delete` command removes trip(s) from the currently displayed trip list. It supports four deletion modes:
* **Single deletion**: deletes a trip at a given index (e.g. `delete 2`)
* **Range deletion**: deletes trips within an index range (e.g. `delete 1-3`)
* **Field-match deletion**: deletes trips matching a field such as name or tag (e.g. `delete n/Tokyo`, `delete t/family`)
* **Date-range deletion**: deletes trips within a specified date range (e.g. `delete sd/2026-01-01 ed/2026-12-31`)

The parsing of the command is handled by `DeleteCommandParser`, which determines which of the four deletion modes is being used based on input format and validates that only one mode is specified per command.

Deletion is performed by `DeleteCommand`, which operates on the **currently displayed trip list**.
For field-match and date-range deletion, matching is handled by `TripMatchesDeletePredicate`:
* field-match deletion checks one specified prefix at a time (e.g. `n/`, `p/`, `t/`, `sd/`)
* date-range deletion (`sd/` and `ed/`) works as follows:
    * different dates → trip start date must be on/after `sd`, and end date must be on/before `ed`
    * same date → any trip happening on that day matches

To prevent accidental deletion, a **two-step confirmation flow** is implemented in `CommandBox`:

1. The first execution transforms the command into `deletepreview`, which shows the trips that would be deleted.
2. The second execution of the same command performs the actual deletion.
3. Editing the command cancels the pending deletion.

The preview is generated using `PreviewDeleteCommand`, which reuses the same parsing and selection logic as `DeleteCommand` to ensure consistency.

The following sequence diagram shows the logic for deleting a trip:

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Delete Command Sequence Diagram" />

### Tagging Trips: Tag Command

The `tag` command allows users to add a single tag to trips for easier organisation and filtering. It only supports tagging by index.

The parsing of the command is handled by `TagCommandParser`, which parses the required arguments and constructs the corresponding `TagCommand`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the process of tagging a trip:

<puml src="diagrams/TagSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Tag Command Sequence Diagram" />

### Filtering Trips by Date: Filter Command

The `filter` command allows user to filter by date range. It enforces both `sd/` and `ed/` present in the query, but accepts trips with null `sd/` and `ed/` fields. `sd/` >= `query sd/` must be present to pass the filter, `ed/` is optional but must be <= `query ed/` to pass the filter.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the process of filtering a trip:

<puml src="diagrams/FilterSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Filter Command Sequence Diagram" />

### Trip Listing and Sorting: List Command

The `list` command has been enhanced to provide analytical feedback and dynamic reordering of the trip log. This implementation bridges the `Logic` and `Model` layers to transform a simple list view into a temporal dashboard.

#### Implementation

**Sorting Mechanism & Tie-Breaking:**
The sorting is implemented using a **Comparator Factory** pattern within `ListCommand`. The selection logic is encapsulated in `getComparator(key)`, which returns a specific comparator that often chains a primary key with a name-based fallback using `.thenComparing()`.

<puml src="diagrams/ListComparatorClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` and `Model` components when a user executes a sort command:

<puml src="diagrams/ListSortSequenceDiagram.puml" width="550" alt="Sequence Diagram for List Sorting" />

To ensure a stable and deterministic user experience, a **Multi-Level Tie-Breaker** is implemented:
1. **Primary Key**: The user-selected key (e.g., `start date`).
2. **Secondary Key (Tie-breaker)**: A case-insensitive alphabetical sort by trip name retrieved via `Trip#getNameLowerCase()`.

**Technical Workflow:**
1. **`ListCommandParser`**: Intercepts the `list` command and identifies the `sort/` prefix.
2. **`getComparator(key)`**: In `ListCommand`, this method chains the primary comparator with a name-based fallback using Java's `.thenComparing()` method.
3. **Persistent Sorting**: The sort order is maintained in the `ModelManager` via a `SortedList` wrapper. Any subsequent operations (adding or editing trips) automatically re-apply the last used comparator through `Model#updateSortedTripList(Comparator<Trip>)`.

**Temporal Dashboard:**
The trip statistics dashboard provides a temporal analysis of trips relative to `LocalDate.now()`. Categorization logic is centralized in `TripSummaryUtil`, using a sequential date-check flow to ensure mutually exclusive trip statuses.

<puml src="diagrams/TripSummaryActivityDiagram.puml" width="300" />

* **Centralized Logic**: The calculation logic is centralized in `TripSummaryUtil#calculateSummary(ObservableList<Trip>)`.
* **Live Updates**: The `ListCommand` retrieves the current filtered list via `Model#getFilteredTripList()` and passes it to the utility to generate the dashboard summary.
* **Status Determination**:
    1. **Planning**: `startDate == null`
    2. **Upcoming**: `today is before start date`
    3. **Completed**: `today is after end date`
    4. **Ongoing**: `else`

### Help command

#### Implementation

The `help` command supports two modes:

1. **Full help window** — `help` (no argument) opens a separate `HelpWindow` popup displaying syntax for all commands.
2. **Inline help** — `help COMMAND` (e.g., `help add`) displays the usage string for a specific command directly in the result display, without opening a window.

The mode is determined in `HelpCommand#execute()`:

* If no argument is given, a `CommandResult` with `showHelp = true` is returned. `MainWindow` detects this flag in `executeCommand()` and calls `handleHelp()`, which shows the window (if hidden) or focuses it (if already visible). The result display shows `SHOWING_HELP_MESSAGE` ("Opened help window.") in both cases. The help window can also be opened or focused via **F1** or the Help menu, which calls `handleHelp()` directly without changing the result display.
* If an argument is given, `getUsageForCommand(argument)` returns the matching usage string, and a regular `CommandResult` is returned. The text is displayed inline in the `ResultDisplay`.

The usage strings (e.g., `ADD_USAGE`, `DELETE_USAGE`) are defined as constants in `CommandUsage` and reused by both `HelpCommand` and `HelpWindow` to keep the content consistent between inline help and the popup window.

The `HelpWindow` is resizable. The `ScrollPane` (which is the scene root) grows to fill the window as the user resizes it, showing a vertical scrollbar only when the content exceeds the window height. A minimum size of 400×300 px is enforced on the `Stage` to prevent the window from being dragged to an unusably small size.

The `TripLogParser` routes `help` to `HelpCommand`:

* `help` → `new HelpCommand(arguments)` where `arguments` is `""`, equivalent in behaviour to `new HelpCommand()`
* `help add` → `new HelpCommand(arguments)` where `arguments` is `" add"`; the leading space is trimmed to `"add"` inside the constructor

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Where to display per-command help**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Display inline in the existing `ResultDisplay`.
    * Pros: No extra window; fast to access; keyboard-friendly.
    * Cons: Long usage text may get truncated if the result area is small.

* **Alternative 2:** Always open a `HelpWindow`, filtered to the requested command.
    * Pros: Consistent UI; more space for content.
    * Cons: More disruptive; requires an extra window management step.

    * Use case resumes at step 3.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. TripLog should work on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems with Java `17` installed.
2. TripLog should run without requiring an installer and should be distributed as a single JAR file, or as a single ZIP file only if additional required files cannot be packaged into the JAR.
3. TripLog should allow users to perform all core operations, including adding, listing, deleting, and tagging trips, through typed commands without requiring mouse-based input.
4. TripLog should be designed for use by one user only and should not support concurrent access to the same data during normal operation.
5. TripLog should store all application data locally in a human-editable text file and should not use a DBMS for storage.
6. TripLog should allow all core features to function without requiring an Internet connection or a remote server.
7. TripLog should support at least 1000 trip records, with typical commands such as `add`, `delete`, `tag`, and `list` completing within 2 seconds on a standard personal computer.
8. TripLog should display error messages for invalid commands and invalid input that state the cause of the error and the expected command format.
9. TripLog should work well at screen resolutions of 1920×1080 and above with 100% and 125% display scaling, and remain usable at 1280×720 and above with 150% display scaling.
10. TripLog should be implemented using a modular object-oriented design so that new commands or trip fields can be added with changes localized to a small number of components.

### Glossary

- **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS
- **Trip**: A travel record identified by a destination name, with optional fields such as start date, end date, address, and tags.
- **Destination**: Primary location of a trip (e.g "Mount Fuji"), mapped to the Name field
- **Experience Log**: Descriptive note added to a trip to record activities or reminders
- **Category Tag**: Label for grouping trips by purpose (e.g work) or region (e.g Japan)
- **Duration**: The total days between the start and end date of a trip.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Effort**

While TripLog originated from AB3, the transition to a travel-specific manager required significant architectural changes:

* **Temporal Logic Implementation**: Unlike static contact data, `Trip` objects are time-dependent. We implemented logic to handle overlapping dates for duplicate detection and created `TripSummaryUtil` to recalculate trip statuses relative to the system clock (`LocalDate.now()`).
* **Complex Command Parsing**: The `delete" command was overhauled to support four distinct modes (Index, Range, Field-Match, and Date-Range). This required a sophisticated `DeleteCommandParser` and custom state-management logic in the UI for the "two-step confirmation" process without modifying the core `Logic` interface.
* **State Persistence**: We expanded `UserPrefs` to include the last-used `sort order`. This required coordination between `Logic` and `Storage` to ensure the app launches exactly as the user left it.
* **Dynamic UI Layout**: We replaced the static vertical stacking of the Trip List and Result Display with a vertically-oriented `SplitPane`. This allows users to manually adjust the height of the feedback area, which is critical for viewing large results (e.g., help commands) without obstructing the primary list.
* **Enhanced UI Feedback**: We integrated dynamic icons and success/error styling in the `ResultDisplay` and `CommandBox`, moving away from AB3's purely text-based feedback.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

**Team size: 6**

1. **Improve Error Message for Invalid Indices**: Currently, when an index is out of bounds or not a positive integer, the app shows a generic error. We plan to specify the valid range based on the current list size (e.g., "Index must be between 1 and 5").
2. **Support for Non-English Characters**: We plan to allow Unicode characters in the destination `NAME` field to support international travel records (e.g., Tokyo / 東京).
3. **Multi-Field Substring Search**: The `find` command currently only searches the Name field. We plan to expand substring matching to include Address and Tags fields simultaneously.
4. **Refine Phone and Email Validation**: Currently, the validation for phone numbers and emails follows a strict alphanumeric format. We plan to allow more flexible symbols (e.g., "+" for country codes in phone numbers) to support international contact details.
5. **Clearer Duplicate Detection Feedback**: When a duplicate trip is rejected, we plan to specify which existing entry it overlaps with (e.g., "Overlaps with trip at index 2") in the feedback box.
6. **Custom Icons Toggle**: Provide a setting in `preferences.json` to allow users to toggle off the custom `[OK]` and `[!!]` icons for a minimalist UI.
7. **Preserve original displayed indices in delete preview**: Currently, the delete preview renumbers matched trips starting from 1 instead of preserving their original indices in the currently displayed trip list. For example, entering `delete 2-3` may preview the selected trips as `1.` and `2.`, even though they correspond to displayed list entries `2.` and `3.`. We plan to update the preview UI so that it preserves the original displayed indices, allowing users to verify more easily that the correct trips have been selected before confirming deletion.
8. **Make oversized delete index error messages more specific**: Currently, when an excessively large numeric index is provided in the `delete` command (e.g. `delete 12345678901211111111`), TripLog may return a misleading error message stating that the index must be a positive integer, even though the input is numerically positive. We plan to refine the validation logic so that oversized numeric inputs that exceed supported bounds produce a clearer message indicating that the index is invalid or out of range, helping users better understand the actual cause of the error.
9. **Support for descending sort order**: Currently, the `list sort/KEY` command only supports ascending order for dates and names. We plan to introduce a suffix (e.g., `list sort/name-d`) to allow users to toggle between ascending and descending order, providing more flexibility in how they view their travel history.
10. **Pagination for large trip logs**: Currently, the `list` command displays all entries in a single view. As the trip log grows, this may cause performance lag or UI clutter. We plan to implement pagination (e.g., `list p/1`) to limit the number of trips displayed per page, ensuring the application remains responsive and the UI stays manageable.
